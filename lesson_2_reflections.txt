What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
No commit is made. So that it becomes a git repository and can be commited.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is used as a staircase to add the bunch of files together into the git repository as a commit. They are generally related logically.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
We can add one file at a time to the staging area to ensure the one commit per logical change. As only files added to staging area are committed.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
Branching is useful when an experimenta feature is to be added or a slightly different logical change has to be made. Branches allow us to edit or change the repository and commit them without affecting the original master branch. Also they can be merged into the master branch later on if required, making it convenient and easy to use.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Diagrams are a good way of representing the branch structure as we can clearly see all the commits at a time and decide their order in that branch.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
